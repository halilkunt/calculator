The Odin project Calculator. Created buttons as grid items and added them to the DOM with an IIFE. Tried to write clean code, variable names and function names are quite understandable. There are a few minor problems and planning to add a few functionality but for now it's quite enough. I'm planning to handle the problems in a few weeks.
